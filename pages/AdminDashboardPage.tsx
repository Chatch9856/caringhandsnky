// This file is no longer used. 
// The AdminLayout.tsx component now provides the overall structure for admin pages.
// Specific admin panels (Bookings, Caregivers, etc.) are routed directly within AdminLayout in App.tsx.
// The main dashboard content can be found in pages/admin_panels/AdminDashboardPanel.tsx.
// The "classic" vs "modern" layout switching is handled within AdminLayout.tsx.
